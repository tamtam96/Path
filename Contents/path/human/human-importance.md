# Human importance

### Conunter argument 1 (cosmological)
- We are nothing compared to the Cosmos
  - We are on Earth, a small planet
  - Of a medium-sized star
  - In a spiral arm of a medium-sized galaxy
  - Of several hundred billion galaxies we see
  - Of a universe that is at least 500 times bigger than our oveservable universe
  - [Hubble Deep Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Deep_Field)
- Thus we are not important
- Thus religions are wrong, because religions emphasize that human being is important (probably center of the creation)

### Counter argument 2 (evolutionary & biological)
- 5 or 7 million species (huge diversity)
- Thus we are not special

### My arguments
- Earth is special
  - Among [known planets till now](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/)
  - Among planest inside [Circumstellar Habitable Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_habitable_zone)
  - Which is not compatible with statistics (the way I know it)
- Who has understood all of these things?
  - Human being
  - Small creature, has understood the entire universe, almost
  - Human brain
  - Conciousness, perception
  - Which means human being is special
  - Because based on [the law of the large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), we should see other species have conciousness and intelligence
