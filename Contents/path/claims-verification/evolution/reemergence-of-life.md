# Reemergence of life

Based on abiogenesis, we should be able to find multiple pathways to multiple different points in time.

In other words, the abiogenesis should still exist, and should build life pathways from non-living material again and again.

Instead of a tree of life, we should see a jungle of life, many trees each starting from another:

- Point in time
- Chemical pathways
