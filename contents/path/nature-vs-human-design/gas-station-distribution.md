# Gas station distribution

- Anything that does something needs energy
  - Donkey
  - Cell phone
  - Car
  - Flower
  - Neighbor's dog
  - Refrigerator
  - ...
- We, as intelligent beings, have designed/created stuff
  - Cell phone
  - Car
  - Refrigerator
  - ...
- Some of our designs are mobile, some immobile
- For mobile stuff, we should solve a problem

### Mobile energy problem
Where should mobile stuff get energy from, when they're out of energy/fuel?

### Our solution?
- Gas station
- Electric plug
- Transportable energy sources
  - Gas can
  - Powerbanks

### Assessment
The higher the distribution of energy-taking-centers, the smarter more powerful we are

### Nature
- Donkey's refuling? Where is grass?
- Hen's refuling? Where is seed and grane?
- Bee's refuling? Where is the next flower?


### Comparison
- Donkey, Hen, Bee = Car, Cell phone
- Grass and seed and flower = gas station, electrical plug


### Conclusion
- We see the highest level of fuel distribution in nature
- Nature > human design
