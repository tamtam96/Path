# Conclusin

- We can never eliminate poverty. Because one reason of poverty is God's will.
    - Ntural evil (fire, flood, earthquake, ...)
    - Human evil (war, injustice, murder, ...)
    - Self evil (laziness, ...)
- Thus we should not aim that.
- Instead, we should help poor, constantly, until our last breath.
