# Knowing **HOW** on smaller scales, or knowing the **CAUSE** in the past, does not rule-out the creation.

### Examples

- When the acceleration pedal is pushed, car accelerates.
    - step 1
    - step 2
    - step 3
    - ...

Knowing steps does not rule-out the need of the design, the need of the engineers.

- Part of the ectoderm is turned into our brain
    - Neural plate
    - Neural groove
    - Neural folds fusion
    - Neural tube
    - Rombencephalon + mesoencephalon + prosencephalon
    - ...
Knowing the chemistry and particle physics of **how** these steps cause one another, does not rule-out the need of creation, then need of design.
