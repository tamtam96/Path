# Stop codon

eof = end of file


### Process termination types

- Resource Exhaustion 
  - Fire
  - Gravity and falling (space exhaustion = impact)
  - ...
 
- Decision (design)
   - Direct decision (command)
     - Granma weaving cloth for grandchild, constantly measuring to see where to stop
     - Cutting disposable plastic sheet (tablecloth)
   - Automatic mechanism
     - Food packaging industry
     - Beverage industry
     - ...

### Protein Synthesis in Prokaryotes 
 
- Polycistronic mRNA
- Coupled transcription and translation
- Linear polyribosomes
- No cap on mRNA
- Start codon is next AUG after ribosome-binding site
- First amino acid is formyl-Met
- 70S ribosomes made of: 30S and 50S subunits
- Small 30S subunit: 16S rRNA and 21 proteins
- Large 50S subunit: 23S and 5S rRNA plus 31 proteins
- Elongation factors: EF-T (2 subunits) and EF-G
- Three initiation factors: IF1, IF2 and IF3
- Shut-off by dimerization of ribosomes in nongrowing cells
