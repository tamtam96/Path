# Quranic medicine

- [Jamshid khodadadi](https://www.aparat.com/v/kIsjW)
  - claim: Quran has **absolutly** not talked about meat and fish as food for human being (listen from 10:30)
  - verification:
     - Salwa for bani israeel
     - eat from meat of sacrificed animal of Haj
     - fish as the food of Moosa (while in search for that slave of Allah)
     - minha ta'kulun is said many times about an'am
     - lahmi tayri mimma yashtahun
