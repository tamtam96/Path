Cell theory => cells arise from pre-existing cells
What about the **first cell(s)**? => Abiogenesis

Abiogenesis = complex mechanism over many years

Question => Then why that complex mechanism stopped? Why we don't see cells being made both from pre-existing cells and also from that complex mechanism?
