<h1>زبان استنتاجی</h1>

<p>ND = non-deductive = غیر استنتاجی</p>
<p>MDT = more deductive term = لفظ استنتاجی تر</p>

<h2>مثال ها</h2>
<p>random access = ND => MDT = direct access</p>
<hr />
<p>Atom (can not be cut) ND</p>
<p>MDT (any meaningless, but small and well-articulated name) rosa</p>
<hr />
<p>atomic number ND</p>
<p>mass number ND</p>
<p>atomic mass ND</p>
<hr />
<p>protons MDT</p>
<p>nucleons MDT</p>
<p>mass MDT</p>
<hr />
<p>عدد پروتونی</p>
<p>عدد نوکلئونی (عدد هسته ای)</p>
<p>عدد جرمی</p>
<hr />
<p>miniature, as the abbreviation for MCB (miniature circuit breaker) = ND => MDT = MCB or ghate'</p>
<hr />
<p>Electric current = ND => MDT = Charged particles' current</p>
<hr />
<p>The "color charge" of quarks and gluons is completely unrelated to the everyday meaning of color. The term color and the labels red, green, and blue became popular simply because of the loose analogy to the primary colors. Richard Feynman referred to his colleagues as "idiot physicists" for choosing the confusing name.</p>
<hr />
<p>SFX = sound effect => ND => MDT = SE</p>
<hr />
<p>voiced vs voiceless => ND => MDT =</p>
<p>vibrated vs vibrationless</p>
<hr />
<p>natural numbers, real numbers, rational numbers, </p>
<hr />
<p>epithelium => above nipple => ND => MDT = </p>
<hr />
<p>cookie (browser) => ND => MDT = small data</p>
<hr />
<p>hypocenter => ND => MDT => center</p>
<hr />
<p>recombination (cosmology) => ND => MDT = first hydrogens, or hydrogen genesis</p>
<hr />
<p>bicarbonate => ND</p>
<p>because "bi" means two and we don't have two of anything in it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Cancer grade & cancer stage are ND. MDT = cancer abnormality & cancer spread</p>
<hr />
<p>Beta particle => ND, MDT = emitted electron, emitted positron</p>
<hr />
<p>Sun and moon letters in Arabic</p>
<p>ND</p>
<p>MDT = stop creating consonants</p>
<hr />
<p>عدد صحیح</p>
<p>referring to a number without fractions</p>
<hr />
<p>MDT = عدد بی کسر</p>
<hr />
<p>Spin in a quantum particle is the angular momentum it has, without spinning. ND. MDT = AM or angular momentum.</p>
<p>MDT = Spineless angular momentum</p>
<hr />
<p>cathode ray is ND</p>
<p>MDT = electron beam</p>
<hr />
<p>Maxwell gave a list of vector quantities in his text, "A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism". He calls them alphabetically thus the magnetic field is now B, because it was listed second. This is very stupid example of how we make things comolicated by not thinking about or fixing naming.</p>
<p>A more understandable language is a more deductive language and vice versa.</p>
<p>Just the way clean code starts with correct naming, clean language and clean science should also start with deductive sensible naming.</p>
<p>MDT => MF (magnetic field)</p>
<hr />
<p>perfect square (square of an integer)</p>
<p>MDT = integer square</p>
<hr />
<p>تصاعد هندسی</p>
<p>geometric progression</p>
<p>it'a non deductive, because it emphasizes unidirectional, increasing meaning.</p>
<p>MDT => geometric sequence</p>
<p>دنباله هندسی</p>
<hr />
<p>Combination and permutation etymologically don't give us enough power to distinguish which is which.</p>
<p>More deductive terms would be:</p>
<hr />
<p>OSC => order-sensitive combination</p>
<p>OIC => order-insensitive combination (permutation)</p>
<hr />
<p>common and proper in grammar at ND (non-deductive).</p>
<p>More deductive terms (MDT) are general & specific.</p>
<hr />
<hr />

- Peistocene = most new != ice age
- Limbic system = edge system (ND)
