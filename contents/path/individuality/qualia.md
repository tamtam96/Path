I can't experience your experience.

I can't understand how you perceive the world.

Using many techniques, I might be able to detect that you're tasting something. But:
- what would its taste like for you? 
- How sweet is it? 
- What memories does it load for you? 
- How are you feeling while tasting it? 
- Do you like it? 
- How much? 
- Is its sweetness different from how I feel it?
