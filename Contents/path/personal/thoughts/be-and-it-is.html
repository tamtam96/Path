    <p>Situation: You've done with your gym workout.</p>
    <p>Be: get clean from sweet.</p>
    <p>Is: clean from sweat</p>
    <p>Mediums: Get a towel, find a shower, walk to the shower, adjust water temperature, wash your hair and face, and body, dry yourself</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Part of your will is the consequence of your needs. You want to eat because your physical body needs a constant food supply. You want to pee because your body constantly produces waste. These wills are not even free. They are forced upon you, and no matter what you do, you can't not will them. You can't will them not to be. This shows how weak we are.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>You're hungry.</p>
    <p>Be: Stomach, get full</p>
    <p>Is: Stomach is full</p>
    <p>Medium-chain: you should cook the food, or order the food. Both have a long chain. But when the food is ready and it's outside your body, you should move it inside. You have to bite it and chew it. Even when your stomach gets full, you realize that your brain will understand by some delay, due to the time needed for chemical secretion and messaging. And this is the most simple scenario. More medium chains are necessary if you have false teeth.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>In the morning when you wake up, your bladder is usually full and you feel this need to empty it.</p>
    <p>Will: empty your bladder</p>
    <p>Realization: Your bladder is emptied</p>
    <p>What comes in between:</p>
    <p>You have to get up, then walk to the bathroom, then sit on the toilet, then let your bladder muscles do the magic, then clean.</p>
    <p>You can find out this medium-chain even better, if for any reason you have medical complications related to your urine system, including kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. For example, if you have a kidney stone blocking your urethra, then your will won't be realized that simple.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>describing the philosophy, and bringing tons of samples</p>
    <hr />
    <p>start a routine day and monitor your wants, and the path/steps you should take to make them happen</p>
