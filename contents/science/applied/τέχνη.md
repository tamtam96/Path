- Can you dig the land?

- Can you vaccum clean under the sofa?
- No, the head of the cleaner does not go there.
- I built a vaccum cleaner with thinner head. I can.

- Can you warm up the food?
- Sure, but it will take 15 minutes.
- Why?
- I can't ask fire to heat up the food faster. If I increase the fire, the food burns.
- But I built a box to use micro-waves instead of fire. I warm up the food in 2 minutes.

- Can you notify your friends to come too?
- Yes. Just let me send a raven/pigeon.
- Why?
- They are not hear. They live far away. Sound waves won't travel fast and they also dampen soon.
- Oh, I built a device to turn sound waves into electromagnetic waves and back to sound waves again. I would call them at the speed of the light.
