<h1>PHP</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Member access operator is sooooooooooooooooo silly.
		<ul>
			<li>-&lt; for instance members (methods and properties, etc.)</li>
			<li>:: for static members</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		The need for &lt;?php processing directive at the top of .php files. If the extension is .php, then it's pure PHP, then why do we need that at all?
	</li>
	<li>
		To call another method from the same class or parent class, you should use $this-&gt; or self:: or parent::, which is very very stupid.
	</li>
