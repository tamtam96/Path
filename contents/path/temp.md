Using technical words does not rule out the existence of the creator.
alcohol, aldehyde, ester, ketone, amid, carboxylic acid, acetal, etc... do not rule out the creation.

Though experiment:

Ask two persons, to describe a house. In detail. List of rooms, dimensions of each place, where are the stuff located, the color of stuff, etc.   
Then compare them. Find similarities.   
Show how chance can't create high amount of similarities.   
Then compare these two lists, to gene mappings of human and chimpanzis and retroviruses and how that means a solid proof that we are from the same ancestor.

Muhammad knew very little about the power, glory, hugeness, and energy in the skies. Then why the adverb *bi-aydin* is used in 51:47?

Compare human production scale (cell phones per year, smaller than that, batteries per year, or even smaller, the most smallest peiece) with natures production rate and scale (cells per year). Just multiply 50 billion cells per day for each person by 8 billion population of the Earth.

Nature wins.

There are a lot of misunderstanding in man-to-man communication. And the reason is that we don't know everything about the other party. We don't know the intention.
Yet there is no misunderstanding when it comes to communicating with the God. Because he knows everything, even intentions, and even things that we don't know about outselves.
