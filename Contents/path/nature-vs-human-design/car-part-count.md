How many parts a car has?

30,000 including bolts and nuts

Less granular than that = molecules and atoms and chemical reactions and physical changes

What if a car is made with 1 million parts?

Is it not more awesome and is the engineers not more intelligent?

Then how about body that has 30 trillion cells?

And each cell has oragenelles.
