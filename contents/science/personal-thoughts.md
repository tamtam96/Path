# My personal thoughts

- How can we know that a single probabalistic event, is not coordinated by an external will, outside our universe?

- How can we make sure that the history of the universe, is real? How can we exclude the idea of **made history**? Made history means a creator creating the universe such that it appears to have a history. For example, a photon in a place that when we receive we think this photon has come from the beginning of Big Bang, but it's been put there just yesterday.

- A phenomenon exists that I don't know its name. I would rather call it **Knowledge dominance**.
    - As long as anyone who's language is not English, learns science, he's a second-hand citizen in the realm of knowledge.
    - Because he has to learn a lot of new terms, just because he wants to learn science
    - Because he has to learn English nomenclature and notation for things and formulas.
        - F=ma
            - Persian => ن = ج ش

- Could dark matter be space-time elasticity? Something aimilar to a spring, but inherent of space-time.
- Division over zero exists, and it equals the infinity (forever).
    - dividing a load of bread between nobody.
- 0.9 does not equal 1. It extends forever.
