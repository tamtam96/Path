### Purpose

One designer, or a group of designers?

***

### Approach

- Scope => spatio-temporal boundaries
    - All of the universe
    - For all of the time
- Examples of constancy (anywhere, anytime)
    - Oxygen + hydrogen = water
    - Atomic interaction => electromagnetic force
    - Mass has gravity
    - The law of definite proportions
    - Quarks => strong nuclear force
    - Nuclear fusion, or fission
    - Star = lighter elements fuse to build heavier elements
    - Speed of light
    - Projectile, gravity, air friction
    - Life is made of cells
    - Life is made of water
    - Life is self-replicatory
    - Gene is in all life
- Examples of inconstancy
    - Wife and husband
    - Presidents (consecutive)
    - Stakeholders (business partners)
    - Two dieties in one religion
- Fact => world's infra is constant
- Interpretation => there is one designer
    - Inductive reasoning
    - No constancy in systems with two or more wills

### Challenges

- Find a system with two or more wills, that is constant over time
- Find a system, even with **ONE** will, that is constant over time
