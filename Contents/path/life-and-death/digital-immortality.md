### Analysis

- Do not wait until I die to upload my mind. Instead of cut-paste, copy-paste. Let me become two points of consciousness.
- You could not make immortality in the biological-physical world, and that's why you've gone to the virtual world
- How can we know that the uploaded mind, or the virtual avatar, is alive?
