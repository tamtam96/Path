# Thermoregulation

| Control Loop Tyes:      | Function                                 |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| - Cruise Control in car | Controls speed of a motor vehicle        |
| - Process variable      | Announce the current level of the system |
| - Set Point             | Set system to the desired level          |

Examples: (PLC Ùˆ PID Controller)
- Keeping the flow of a liquid in a tube constant.
- Keeping the pressure of a gas in a tank constant.
- Keeping the temperature of a system constant.

| Thermorecelitor | Sending messages to the brain (Hypothalamus) | Sweating to cool the body / Muscle tremors to warm the body |


In Short:
- Thermal receivers signal.
- The hypothalamus processes.
- We sweat to cool down.
- We tremble to warm up.
- As long as the temperature returns to normal.
