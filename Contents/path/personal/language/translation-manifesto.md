Translation Manifesto

- A translator is expected to know both the source language and the target language well.
- Fluent Persian is expected. We don't argue if editing is part of the job description of a translator or not, we simply want it from our colleagues in the translation department. It's up to you to choose if you want to be our colleague or not. Your Persian should be such that any Persian language speaker can attest it's fluent.
- Translation mistakes are acceptable in work. That's part of the deal. Nobody knows English 100%. But Persian mistakes are not acceptable. If you continue translating with us, you agree on reviewing your Persian or taking whatever mechanism necessary to deliver fluent Persian, without mistakes.
- If you can't translate an "entity", (a recipe, a historical event, an investment article, a body part anatomy, etc.), simply pass it and don't provide the wrong translation for it. We accept empty/undone translations, but we don't and we can't accept WRONG translations.
- We need a pace that we can rely on. You should manage your time such that you spend 8 hours of your fresh time for us. This is how work is defined universally. 9-5 is the standard used in many countries. From that 8 hours, we expect 6 hours to be fully productive. We need that pace.
- We don't author, we don't interpret. We only translate. Yet, we're free to change as much as it's necessary to make it more fluent in Persian.
- Please note that "wrong translation" can not be used as fluency justification.
- You need to have touch-typing skills. We accept that you don’t have it on start. But we won’t accept it if you don’t gain it during the first 3 months of our cooperation. We will teach you if you want.
- We believe in mutually beneficial relations. We even believe in connections, more than relations. We respect your rights as colleagues, and we fight as much as we can to provide more welfare for you. In return, we need a quality translation. So to form new cooperation is what we strive for. But to not be colleagues is better than to be bad colleagues.
