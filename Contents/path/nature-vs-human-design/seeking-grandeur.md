Why is it so that we always seek for greatness?

Just look the history and look at the media.

It's always about "bigs".

Bigger companies, bigger ambitions, bigger money, bigger tech, bigger stadium, bigger statue, bigger roads, bigger cities, bigger hospitals, bigger towers, bigger x, bigger y.

What other thing or being or living organism cares about grandeur?

What has human made to care about grandeur?
