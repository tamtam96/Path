# [Touch typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing)

### Lessons

- Type letters, not words
- Type using a steady speed
    - You should [hear keystrokes steadily](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxVIpWfQhuE).
- Raise your wrist, don't let them touch the desk
    - Similar to a pianist
    - Because you have to be able to touch numbers and symbols too
    - You should be able to move your hands from the shoulder.
- Each finger supports a backslash () on the keyboard.
    - [See a keyboard image](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TBg4r1oNL._AC_SL1500_.jpg).
- Home keys are F for the left hand and J for the right hand.
    - It's called **touch** typing for a reason.
    - It would be best to touch the keyboard, not look at it.
- There are three components: **source**, **keyboard**, and **monitor**. Never look at the last two. Just look at the source. If no source exists, the source is your mind. You should be able to type with closed eyes.
- Corrections come after typing, not during typing.
- Opposite hand presses the Shift key for capital letters or whenever required.
- You should memorize keyboard letters, numbers, symbols, etc.

### Explanation

Touch-typing is what I might describe as "typing fast on the keyboard, without seeing it and using nine fingers." But why it's called touch-typing? It's because you must not look at the keyboard, and the only way you can get a sense of where your fingers are right now is by touching the keyboard, specifically some keys which are designed for touch purposes. 

However, I might say that *touch-typing* is not a good term (ND or non-deductive), and a more deductive term (an MDT) might be *fast-typing* because semantics here emphasizes speed in using the keyboard and pressing keys, not touching the keyboard.

### Why it's good?

- Data entry volume measurement (you need to install a keystroke counter application, like WhatPulse)
- Your speed (you need to measure your speed using some touch-typing speed meter applications, like TypingMaster)
- Calculating the time you can gain by touch-typing
