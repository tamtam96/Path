Sperm and Eggs:

23 Chromosomes (Haploid).

 Sex cells:
 
 46 Chromosomes (Diploid). From dad & momm for Spermatogenesis.
 
 Problem:
 
Extra chromosomes =» Not Forming Sperm =» Stopping being Polyspermy

Function:

sperm enters(signaling pathway) =» Release egg into outer space =» Compound Wall & Material Inside(Zona Pellucida)
