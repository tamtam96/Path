For the whole world becoming consumerists the way Americans are, we need 4 Earths

Right now, Earth only supporta 2 billion people being consumerists.

The rest of us can not become consumerists, simply because of the lack of resources.

Just think:

Can we all become CEOs?

Calling to consumerism is falsehood
