# My persoanl SPL upgrade

Today I upgraded from dotnet 3.1 to dotnet 6.0, in 3 hours.

It had no difference for me to upgrade 10 projects, or 100 projects, or a thousand projects.

Because I have created the infrastructure for them. I only upgraded the infra.

[31:28](https://quran.com/31/28)

The above verse, I accept with all of my heart. I believe it 100%.
