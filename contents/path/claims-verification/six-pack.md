<h1>Six Pack</h1>

<p>
Look at the animal world. No animal has six pack. Even the strongest animals like lion and bear do not have six packs. Their bellies are soft and when they eat, it stretches.
</p>

<p>
Look at the anatomy and physiology of the stomach and organs inside your belly. Your intestines, your digestive organs, your peritoneum. They are built to stretch. Your belly is like camel's back. It should store food and energy for future. That's the original design.

<p>
A man should have strength. Big biceps. Big chests. But not six pack. Six pack is not our nature.
</p>

<p>
A woman should be flexible and kind and soft. She is not supposed to have six-packs. That's not her nature.

<p>
Sixpack, as the product of modern media, is but a tool for market making and capitalism.
