# Hadith & narrative

### Variances across sects

- Count of daughters of Prophet
- Wudu
- Salat
- Asma alhusna
- Asbab alnuzul
- ...

### Question

How it is claimed that narratives and hadith is firm, while these variances come out of it?

### Revelation interruption

> However, what is established by authentic traditions is that after this first Revelation, no Revelation came down to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) for quite some time. Then, when it was resumed, it started with theme verses of Surah Al- Muddaththir. Imam Zuhri has given the following details of it:

> "Revelation to the Holy Prophet remained suspended for quite some time, and it was such a period of deep grief and distress for him that he started going early to the tops of the mountains to throw himself down from them. But whenever he stood on the edge of a peak, the Angel Gabriel would appear and tell him that he was Allah's Prophet. This would console him and restore to him full peace of mind." (Ibn Jarir).

Can anyone accept that a prophet of Allah attempts suicide?

Yes, we have clues of complaning about pain in the Quran by Maryam and Yaqub. We have also seen Yunus flee. But suicide is a whole other level.
