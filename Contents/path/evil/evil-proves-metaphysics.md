Inside a star  core, matter is crushed so hard it fuses and releases energy. Does it complain? Does it see that pressure as evil?

The space temperature throughout the universe is 2.7 Kelvin. Does matter complain about it to be evil?

Once in a while over any planet volcanos errupt, or it shakes, or it's hit by a meteor. Does it comolain and see it as evil?

So, what makes human different? Where does pain come from?

To me, the very perception of evil (pain and agony and fear and sadness, etc) proves metaphysics and refutes materialism
