# Restating metaphysics

I have found that some thinkers deny the possiblity of creation and deny any metaphysical and spiritual claim, and then they come and explain the metaphysical phenomenon in new terms:

### Examples

- [Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(sociology))
  - [I'malu ma shi'tum](https://quran.com/41/40)
- [Simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis)
  - The whole creation with one creator
