- Why one calls Abubakr amiralmu'minin the other Ali?
- Why one touches his entire head in wudu, the other only part of it?
- Why one stands with hands folded in prayer, the other with hands down the sides?
- Why we don't know the true number of Prophet daughters certainly? Why is there debate about it?
