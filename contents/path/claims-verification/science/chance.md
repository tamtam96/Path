# Chance, randomness, spontaneity, accident, stochasticism

#### Requirement

- Prove that *single instance/occurrence of probability event is not influenced by trans-universal will*
   - تک رخداد احتمالی ربطی به اراده فراکیهانی نداره

### Box thought experiment

- You live inside a box
- Sometimes you see light points on any wall
- You call it random, because:
    - You can't formulate
    - You can't predict
- The only formula is, **macroscopic**
    - In every thousand light points, all walls are involved
    - In each million light points, all walls are involved almost equally (with less than 1% deviation)
    - Mass occurrence
        - Can be formulated (probability)
        - Can be predicted

- Let's imagine someone's the outside of the box
- Of course, you can't see him
- He casts those light points at walls

### Requirement

- Prove this entity does not exist, mathematically

### Our understanding of science

- In math
    - No formulation and no determinism = probability
    - Single occurance
        - Has no formula
        - Can not be predicted
        - Is labeled *chance* => ***This is interpretation, not fact***
    - Massive occurances
        - Have objective formula
        - Can be predicted

### Examples

- Forming the first RNA from nucleotides => chemical chance
- Big bang's hot, dense point => Heisenberg uncertainty principle for time and energy
- Radioactive decay
    - > Radioactive decay is a stochastic (i.e. random) process at the level of single atoms. According to quantum theory, it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decay, regardless of how long the atom has existed.[2][3][4] However, for a significant number of identical atoms, the overall decay rate can be expressed as a decay constant or as half-life.

### Interpretations

- Single occurrence is a blind chance, there is no need to prove it, and Creator does not exist
- Single occurrence is the will of a trans-universal Creator
    - Admin access to program *Universe.exe*
    - Affecting the program's flow, through single unformulated unpredictable occurrences.
