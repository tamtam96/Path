# Conclusion
Nature is truly greater in design than intelligent human beings.   
Therefore I don't accept that it's created by blind chance.  
I accept that it's designed.


### Notes:

- Evolution parameters:
    - Chance
    - Time
    - Survival of the fittest
- Human future has no impact on this list. Because humans consider themselves intelligent at this point in time. We need **intelligence** for comparison, which is abundant already.
